# Machine Learning Examples in Python

This repository contains practical, self-contained examples of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. Each example demonstrates how to apply a particular algorithm or technique to a real or synthetic dataset using common tools such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

The goal of this project is to provide concise, readable code for understanding, experimenting with, and adapting ML methods in real-world scenarios.

## Structure

The repository is organized by algorithm or task type. Each subfolder contains:

- A standalone Python script (`.py`) with minimal dependencies  
- Sample data or instructions to acquire the dataset  
- Clear inline comments explaining key steps  
- Optional visualization or performance output  

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
